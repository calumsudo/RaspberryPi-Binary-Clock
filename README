Just wanted to voice a concern regarding my partner and my submission for the pi as binary clock. Upon starting the scrolling pi project we have come to the realization that for the entirety of the pi as binary clock we were supposed to be working within a git repository. However we did the entire project locally on our pi(not in a repository until submission) while screen sharing and being on discord voicechat. We wanted to assure you that we both did an even amount of work as we did every part of the project together by both writing the entire code at the same time on our own pi’s. Hope this might clear up any flags that might’ve got off due to our complete lack of using the git repository prior to submitting.
